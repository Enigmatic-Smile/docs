# Cards
The Card object holds information about the card details submitted by the user using the web or mobile SDKs. One user may link multiple debit or credit cards. 

## Add Card with SDK (preferred)

In order to link a card to a program, we recommend that you use our secure and PCI compliant SDKs. These require the user to enter their card number and expiry date. The SDK will be prepopulated with the country code and the `programId` of the Program you want to link their card to. On submission, the card number is tokenised and transmitted directly from our secure pre-built iframe to the API. This way, your servers are never exposed to sensitive information, removing all PCI compliance requirements from your side.

  To facilitate users linking multiple cards, add identication key:value pairs from your system in the metadata field.
</div> 

We never store card numbers. To identify the user in a transaction object you can use the `cardId` property. After this point only the `cardId` is exchanged between your servers, the card networks and Fidel's API.

After the card is linked successfully, we will monitor any purchase made by this card at any of the programâ€™s physical or online locations. The transaction object will be sent to a webhook URL specified by you.

## Add Card with API

To add a card using the API, you must be PCI Compliant. Contact us at developer@fidel.uk for more information.

### Card Linking in Test

#### API Playground
To test adding cards to a program, go to the [**API Playground**](https://dashboard.fidel.uk/playground), and choose **Add Card** from the left menu endpoints.  The method is set to POST and the endpoint to **_/cards_**.  When you choose the program that you would like to connect the card to from the dropdown, the POST url will change to show the program ID.  In the edit field of the playground is the JSON object that will be used to add the card. To add a card, use one of the available testing card numbers displayed below, an expiry date in the future, and the three letter `countryCode`. You must set `termsOfUse` to `true` to define that the user agreed to the terms of use and opt-in. 

<div class="info-box">
    <small>Important note</small><br/>
    To use the <strong>Create Card</strong> endpoint, you must use the test public key. Using the <strong>Create Card</strong> API endpoint on live environment requires your company to be PCI Compliant. If you want to use the API instead of the SDKs, please contact us at developer@fidel.uk.

When the card is successfully linked, the newly created card object is returned in JSON and displayed in the response body box. If the card linking fails, the failure object will be delivered instead.  

### Testing Card Linking with the Web SDK

You can also use the [Web SDK](/web-sdk) to create cards in test environment using your test public key. If an error occurs on card creation, you receive the error message in the HTTP response body.

## Testing Card Numbers

Use the following test card number ranges to test card linking in test mode, either in the Playground or using the SDKs or APIs with your test public API key.

**Visa**: `4444000000004***`  
**Mastercard**: `5555000000005***`  
**Amex**: `3400000000003**` and `3700000000003**`

Where `*` can be any number. E.g. `4444000000004278`, `5555000000005093` and `370000000000388` are all valid test card numbers.
