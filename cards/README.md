# Cards
The Card object holds information about the card details submitted by the user using the web or mobile SDKs. One user can link multiple cards, debit or credit under the same account.

In order to link a card to a program, we recommend that you use our secure and PCI compliant SDKs. The user will enter their 16-digit card number, and expiry date.  The SDK will be prepopulated with the country code and the `programId` of the Program you want to link this card to. On submission, he card number is tokenised and transmitted directly from our secure pre-built iFrame to the API. This way, your servers are never exposed to sensitive information, removing all PCI compliance requirements from your side.

We never store the 16-digit card number, but rather use the `cardId` to the user. After a user signs up, only the  `cardId` is exchanged between your servers, the card schemes and Fidel API.

After the card is linked successfully, we will monitor any purchase made by this card on any of the programâ€™s physical or online locations and send the transaction object to a webhook URL specified by you.

## Add Card

### Testing Card Linking with the API Playground
To test adding cards to a program, go to the [**API Playground**](https://dashboard.fidel.uk/playground), and choose **Add Card** from the left menu endpoints.  The method is set to POST and the endpoint to **_/cards_**.  When you choose the program that you would like to connect the card to from the dropdown, the POST url will change to show the program ID.  In the edit field of the playground is the JSON object that will be used to add the card. To add a card, use one of the e available testing card numbers displayed below, an expiry date in the future, the three letter `countryCode`. You must set `termsOfUse` to `true` to define that the user agreed to the terms of use and opt-in.

    To use the <strong>Create Card</strong> endpoint, you must use the test public key. Using the <strong>Create Card</strong> API endpoint on live environment requires your company to be PCI Compliant (and will use the secret key. If you want to use it instead of the SDKs, please contact us at developer@fidel.uk.

##### Create sample cards in test mode using the API Playground.

![Create card](https://docs.fidel.uk/assets/images/create-card.png "Create card")

When the card is successfully linked, the newly created card object is returned in JSON and displayed in the response body box. If the card linking fails, the failure object will be delivered instead.  
### Testing Card Linking with the Web SDK
You can also use the [Web SDK](/web-sdk) to create cards in test environment using your public test key. If an error occurs on card creation, you receive the error message in the HTTP response body.

## Testing Card Numbers

Note that on the Playground you can only create cards in test mode. In live mode new cards can only be linked to programs using the SDKs or the API if you are PCI compliant.

Use the following test card number ranges to test card linking in test mode, either in the Playground or using the SDKs with your test SDK key.

**Visa**: `4444000000004***`  
**Mastercard**: `5555000000005***`  
**Amex**: `3400000000003**` and `3700000000003**`

Where `*` can be any number. E.g. `4444000000004278`, `5555000000005093` and `370000000000388` are all valid test card numbers.
