# Getting Started

Fidel API lets you connect your applications to credit and debit cards and monitor transactions in-store and online, chip & pin or contactless.

Card numbers are instantly tokenised and we return to you a unique token that identifies each successfully linked card on your database. You should save the `id` of the card object that is returned inside your user's object. Every transaction we will send to you will have a `cardId` that you can use to identify the user that made that transaction.

## 1. Create an account
First step is to [create a Fidel API developer account](https://dashboard.fidel.uk/sign-up) that will give you access to the developers' dashboard, card-linked program configuration, sandbox environment and test API keys.

## 2. Get API keys
After you created an account, in your account page on the dashboard, you will find two SDK keys and two API keys. The SDK keys are used to link the web and mobile SDKs to your account and the API keys to access the API endpoints directly. [See API Reference.](https://reference.fidel.uk) To access the test environment data you must use the test keys and to access the live environment data use the live keys.

##### Your SDK and API keys are displayed in your account page

When you're ready to go live with your integration and test with plastic credit/debit cards on VISA, Mastercard and American Express networks you can request access to the live keys by using the test-live switch on your dashboard.

## 3. Install SDKs
You can use the web and mobile SDKs to capture your userâ€™s card number and link cards to your program without the need of additional security implementations on your server-side code.

Click on the links below to see how to use the web and mobile SDKs in your applications.

The [Card-Linking tutorial](/tutorials/card-linking) walks you through all the necessary steps to start using the Fidel APIs and SDKs.

Follow the links above to access more detailed documentation and integration instructions for the [Web SDK](/web-sdk/v3) and [mobile SDKs](/mobile-sdks), learn how to customize the UI and capture card details securely on your website or mobile applications. Check [Brands](/brands), [Programs](/programs), [Cards](/cards), [Transactions](/transactions) and [Webhooks](/webhooks) sections to get an overview of the Fidel API object structure.

Check out the [API Reference](https://reference.fidel.uk) to see all available requests, code examples and response payloads.

You can see an example implementation for integrating the Fidel APIs and Web SDK in our [sample application on GitHub](https://github.com/FidelLimited/fidel-api-sample-app).

## 4. Rate Limits
To ensure fair usage and maintain system stability, Fidel API implements rate limits based on the token bucket algorithm.
This algorithm ensures a smooth and predictable distribution of requests by maintaining a bucket of tokens. 
Each request consumes one token from the bucket, and once the bucket is empty, further requests are temporarily rejected until new tokens are replenished at a fixed rate.

These limits define the maximum number of requests that can be made within a specific time frame.
By adhering to these limits, you can optimize the performance of your application while preventing abuse or overloading of the system.

When the number of request submissions exceeds the predefined steady-state request rate and burst limits, the API will respond with an HTTP status code of 429 (Too Many Requests).
It is important to handle this response appropriately in your code to ensure smooth operation of your application.

The rate limits for the Fidel API are categorized based on the endpoint being accessed.
Each endpoint has its own set of limits to control the number of requests allowed within a given period. Rate limits are currently being applied to the following endpoints:

<table style="width:100%;">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        <div>Endpoint</div>
      </th>
      <th>
        <div>Burst limit</div>
      </th>
      <th>
        <div style="">Rate limit</div>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="https://reference.fidel.uk/reference/create-card">Create Card</a>
      </td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>1 per second</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
