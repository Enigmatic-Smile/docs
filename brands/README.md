# Brands

After creating an account and getting access to the dashboard, the next step is to create a test **Brand** (Merchant). This lets you create locations and add them to a Program so you can start tracking transactions. 


  
The **Brand** object is used to aggregate locations and keep track of the Brand consent. To track real-time transactions at a Brand's locations, you need to obtain consent from authorised personnel (Brand User), and provide the Brand with access to view transactional data. You can do this when creating the Brand (see below).

Once you create a **Brand**, it cannot be deleted.

## Create Brand

To create a new Brand, go to the **Brands** page on the dashboard, click the **+** icon and enter a name. Optionally, you can add a link to the brand logo.

To automatically request Brand consent, enter the name and email of the Brand User and Fidel will send an email inviting the Brand User to create a Brand account at [clo.fidel.uk](https://clo.fidel.uk). By creating an account the Brand User provides consent and will have access to transactions made by cardholders at participating locations.

If you're funding your own offers, or you've received direct authorisation from a brand, you can now auto-approve the brand's consent â€“ [see here](https://releasenotes.fidel.uk/auto-approve-brand-consent-92004) for more information.

Brand Consent is only required in the Live environment. Test Brands are automatically given Brand consent.

You can monitor consent status on the dashboard and also set up a `brand.consent` webhook to be notified when the status changes.

##### Go to the Brands page on the dashboard to create a new brand.
