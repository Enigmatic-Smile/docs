## Web SDK
**FIDEL Web SDK** is a secure HTML iFrame with customisable pre-built UI that allows you to easily collect credit card details, tokenize and link credit and debit cards with loyalty services from your website or e-commerce platform. By using FIDEL Web SDK, card details are sent directly to Fidel through a secure connection without exposing your servers to sensitive information taking care of all PCI compliance requirements for you.

<br/>

After successfully tokenizing and linking the card on Visa or MasterCard networks, Fidel returns a unique token that you use to map each unique card to your user's account. You can now create card-linked web applications with online-to-offline marketing capabilities in a matter of minutes.

All modern desktop and mobile browsers are supported, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft IE and Edge. Please contact us at [developer@fidel.uk](mailto:developer@fidel.uk) if you experience any browser issues.
