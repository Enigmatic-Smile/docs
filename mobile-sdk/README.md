## Mobile SDKs

The native mobile SDKs allow you to integrate card linkign technology in your mobile apps in minutes. Card details are collected securely, removing any PCI compliance requirements from your side. See below code examples on how to integrate the SDKs in your apps. 

For more detailed documentation about any class in the SDKs and available customisation options, check the Github repositories for [iOS](https://github.com/FidelLimited/fidel-ios) and [Android](https://github.com/FidelLimited/fidel-android).
