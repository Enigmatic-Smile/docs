## Introduction

Fidel API provides a developer-friendly, secure and reliable API for businesses to link payment cards with mobile and web applications. Through a single API, developers can securely access data from the three major card networks and build their applications on top of the powerful payments infrastructure.

**When a consumer makes a purchase at a participating store with a linked card, Fidel API spots that transaction and sends it to your server in real-time through webhooks.** üí≥‚ö°Ô∏è

Fidel API runs on top of global payment networks, so it doesn‚Äôt require changes to existing merchant infrastructures. No need for new software, POS integrations, staff training or new cards. All the PCI compliance requirements are managed by us so you don‚Äôt have to.

Currently, the API is available in the **United States**, **UK**, **Ireland**, **Canada**, **Sweden** and **UAE**. **Japan** is currently in beta stage. Read the full list of available locations for the [Select Transactions API](https://fidelapi.com/products/select-transactions) and for the [Transaction Stream API](https://fidelapi.com/products/transaction-stream) on the product pages. We work continuously to add support for other countries and networks. If you would like to deploy card-linked applications in other countries please [contact us](https://fidelapi.com/contact).

You can see an example implementation for integrating the Fidel APIs and Web SDK in our [sample application on GitHub](https://github.com/FidelLimited/fidel-api-sample-app).

Check out the [API Reference](https://reference.fidel.uk) to see all available requests, code examples and response payloads.

Join our [Developer Community](https://community.fidel.uk/) for API discussions, documentation, frequently asked questions, roadmap and new features. We‚Äôre always happy to help and answer any questions.

## Card Linking
The [iOS](/mobile-sdks/#ios), [Android](/mobile-sdks/#android) and [Web](/web-sdk/v3) SDKs provide you a secure UI to collect your user‚Äôs card details securely on the web or mobile.

By using Fidel API SDKs, card details are sent directly to Fidel API through a secure connection without exposing your servers to sensitive information taking care of all PCI compliance requirements. [Our Card-Linking tutorial](/tutorials/card-linking) explains in detail all the steps required to build a card-linking feature into your application using the Fidel API SDKs.

Your apps will receive an `id` back that identifies the card in each transaction.
