# Web SDK

**The Fidel Web SDK** is a secure HTML iframe with customisable pre-built UI that allows you to easily collect credit card details, tokenise and link credit/debit cards with rewards services from your website, e-commerce platform or mobile apps. By using the Fidel Web SDK, card details are sent directly to Fidel API through a secure connection without exposing your servers to sensitive information taking care of all PCI compliance requirements for you.

After successfully tokenising and linking the card on Visa, Mastercard or American Express networks, Fidel API returns the created card object with a unique `id` that you must use to link each unique card and transaction to your userâ€™s account. The `id` of each linked card is present on the transaction object as `cardId`. You can now create card-linked web and mobile applications with online and offline transactional data visibility in a matter of minutes.

All modern desktop and mobile browsers are supported, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft IE and Edge. Please contact us at [devrel@fidel.uk](mailto:devrel@fidel.uk) if you experience any browser related issues.
