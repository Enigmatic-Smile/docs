## class Fidel

This class is designed as a facade, used to configure the (verified) card enrollment process, via many of its [static properties](#properties), and start [different flows](#methods). It's also the class that provides [callbacks](#callbacks) that might be useful for your application.

## Properties

### Mandatory properties

These are properties that must be set correctly. In the case where one of these properties are not set or they are set incorrectly, the SDK will return an error in the `onResult` callback (of type: `FidelErrorType.SdkConfigurationError`).

#### sdkKey: String

This key is used to authenticate your Fidel API account. Get it from your Fidel API dashboard -> Account Settings -> SDK Keys section.

> Important note: For security reasons, please DO NOT store the SDK Key in your codebase. Follow our [SDK security guide](/stream/sdks/security-guidelines) for detailed recommendations.

> Note: If you use a **test SDK Key**, your users can only enroll [test card numbers](/stream/cards/#test-card-numbers).

#### programId: String

The program ID indicates the Fidel API program in which the cards will be enrolled. Get the program ID by navigating to the Fidel API dashboard -> Programs section -> Click on the ID of the program you want to use. Clicking on it will copy the ID in your pasteboard.

#### companyName: String

By setting this property we customize the consent text, that the cardholder needs to read and agree with, before enrolling a card.

The maximum number of characters allowed for this property is `60`.

#### termsAndConditionsUrl: String

By setting this property we add a link to your Terms & Conditions in the consent text. The cardholder needs to read and agree with your terms, before enrolling a card.

### Optional properties (but we recommend setting them)

The following properties are technically not mandatory to be set. However, in order to make your Expense Management use case work with your Transaction Stream program, please consider setting them correctly.

#### programType: ProgramType

Default value: `ProgramType.TRANSACTION_SELECT`

It specifies the type of program you want to enroll cards into. The `ProgramType` influences the flow that the SDK will show to cardholders when enrolling cards. 

> Note: For your Expense Management application, you need to use a Transaction Stream program, so you need to set this property to `ProgramType.TRANSACTION_STREAM`.

#### supportedCardSchemes

Type: `Set<CardScheme>`

Default value: `setOf(CardScheme.VISA, CardScheme.MASTERCARD, CardScheme.AMERICAN_EXPRESS)`

> Important: For Expense Management use cases via Transaction Stream programs, only Visa cards are supported. So you need to set this property to `setOf(CardScheme.VISA)`.

Sets a list of supported card schemes. If a card scheme is supported, cardholders will be able to enroll and verify their card. If a card scheme is not in the list, then the cardholders will see an error message while typing or pasting the unsupported card number.

If you set a `null` value, you will not be able to start the Fidel SDK verified enrollment flow. In this case, immediately after attempting to start the flow, you will receive an error in the `onResult` callback (of type: `FidelErrorType.SdkConfigurationError`).

#### enum class CardScheme

Cases:

- `VISA`, `MASTERCARD`, `AMERICAN_EXPRESS`

#### allowedCountries

Type: `Set<Country>`

Default value: `setOf(Country.CANADA, Country.IRELAND, Country.JAPAN, Country.NORWAY, Country.SWEDEN, Country.UNITED_ARAB_EMIRATES, Country.UNITED_KINGDOM, Country.UNITED_STATES)`

> Important: For Expense Management use cases via Transaction Stream programs, please set only a subset of the following countries: `UNITED_KINGDOM`, `UNITED_STATES`, `CANADA`, as these are the only supported countries.

Sets the list of countries that cardholders can pick to be the card issuing country. When two or more countries are set, cardholders will be able to select the card issuing country with our country selection UI.

If you set a value with only one country (`size` of this set == 1), the country selection UI will not be displayed in the card enrollment screen. The country that you set will be considered the card issuing country for all cards enrolled in your Fidel API program using the SDK.

If you set an empty value, you will not be able to start the verified enrollment flow. Instead you will receive an error in the `onResult` callback (`FidelErrorType.SdkConfigurationError`), immediately after the attempt to start.

##### enum class Country

Cases:

- `CANADA, IRELAND, JAPAN, NORWAY, SWEDEN, UNITED_ARAB_EMIRATES, UNITED_KINGDOM, UNITED_STATES`

> Important: For Expense Management use cases via Transaction Stream programs, only cards issued in `CANADA`, `UNITED_KINGDOM`, `UNITED_STATES` are supported.

#### deleteInstructions: String

Default value: `"going to your account settings"`

This text informs the cardholder how to opt out of transaction monitoring in your program. It is appended at the end of the consent text. The maximum number of characters allowed for this property is `60`.

#### defaultSelectedCountry: Country

Default value: `UNITED_KINGDOM`

> Important: For Expense Management use cases via Transaction Stream programs, please use one of the following cases: `.UNITED_KINGDOM`, `UNITED_STATES`, `CANADA`, as these are the only supported countries.

Sets the `Country` that will be selected by default when the user opens the card enrollment screen. If the `defaultSelectedCountry` is not part of the `allowedCountries` list, then the first country in the `allowedCountries` list will be selected.

#### privacyPolicyUrl: String?

Default value: `null`.

If you provide a value for this parameter, the card enrollment consent text will include a phrase that will provide the user with more privacy related information at the URL that you provide.

When the value of this parameter remains `null` no such phrase will be displayed in the card enrolling consent text.

If you provide an invalid URL string, you will not be able to start the card enrollment flow. Instead you will receive an error in the `onResult` callback (`FidelErrorType.SdkConfigurationError`), immediately after attempting to start the verified card enrollment flow.

### Optional properties

#### thirdPartyVerificationChoice: Boolean

Default value: `false`.

When set to `true`, after enrolling the card, the cardholder will enter a screen from which it is possible to choose to continue the experience based on whether the cardholder:
1. Has access to the card statement. In this case the experience will continue with the card verification screen allowing the cardholder to complete the process on the spot.
2. Does not have access to the card statement. In this case the verification of the card will not be done by the cardholder. It needs to be delegated to a third party entity. Usually, in a corporate card setting, the third party entity is a corporate card administrator.

#### metaData: org.json.JSONObject?

This is a JSONObject that you can use to associate custom data with an enrolled card.

We advise setting an `"id"` key -> value pair in this JSONObject. Later, it might be useful for you to use our [List Cards from Metadata ID](https://transaction-stream.fidel.uk/reference/list-cards-from-metadata-id) API Endpoint to query for cards using this ID.

Example of meta data that you can set:

```swift
val jsonMetaData = JSONObject()
jsonMetaData.put("id", "this-is-the-metadata-id")
jsonMetaData.put("myUserId", "123")
jsonMetaData.put("customKey", "customValue")
Fidel.metaData = jsonMetaData
```

You would receive a JSONObject that is equal to this one, after successfully enrolling a card, in the `onResult` callback, in the `EnrollmentResult` object.

#### bannerImage: Bitmap?

Default value: `null`.

Will display the banner image that you set in this parameter at the top of the card details screen.

The banner image will take the device's width, but it has a fixed height of 100 dp.
The image view has the `android:scaleType="centerCrop"` attribute, which means that the banner image that you set will fill its entire predefined area.

For the banner image that you can set, we suggest to use the aspect ratio of the smallest devices that you support. On wider devices, the banner image will be cropped from top and bottom sides. This is because of the `android:scaleType="centerCrop"` attribute that we set for the image view.

If a device that opens the SDK has 320dp in width, the aspect ratio of the image view would be *320 : 100*.
If a device that opens the SDK has 475dp in width, the aspect ratio of your banner image would be *475 : 100*.

You need to provide the image for all screen densities.

Depending on what you want to display in the banner image, you might need to experiment a bit to make sure that nothing important from the image is hidden. The most important information should be displayed in the centre of the banner image.

### Properties that are not in use for Transaction Stream programs

The following properties are only useful when enrolling cards in a Select Transactions program.

#### programName: String

Default value: `"our"`

This value is used in the consent text when enrolling a card issued in a United States or Canada, in a Select Transactions program.

## Methods

### start(context: Context)

Starts a card enrollment flow. If you set the `programType` to:
1. `TRANSACTION_STREAM`, a verified card enrollment flow will be started, for your Transaction Stream program (usually used by Expense Management applications).
2. `TRANSACTION_SELECT`, a regular card enrollment flow will be started, for your Transaction Select program (usually used by Loyalty applications).

#### Parameters

### onCardVerificationStarted: OnCardVerificationStartedObserver

The `OnCardVerificationStartedObserver` interface has only one function:

```kotlin
fun onCardVerificationStarted(details: ConsentDetails)
```

Will be called when the card verification process has started. This callback is similar to the `card.verification.started` webhook that Fidel API is providing. We advise using the webhook, in most situations, to understand when card verification has started for a card that was enrolled.

Parameters:
- a `ConsentDetails` object, representing the details of the consent that the SDK creates after enrolling the card. This is what triggers the verification process to start.

#### data class ConsentDetails

The details of the consent that the SDK creates via the Fidel API in order to start a card verification process.

Properties:
- `cardId: String`: The card ID for which the consent was created.
- `consentId: String`: The identifier of the consent that was created.
- `programId: String`: The identifier of the program the card was enrolled into.

### onCardVerificationChoiceSelected: OnCardVerificationChoiceSelectedObserver _(!Experimental)_

The `OnCardVerificationChoiceSelectedObserver` has only one function:

```kotlin
fun onCardVerificationChoiceSelected(choice: CardVerificationChoice)
```

This is an _experimental_ feature. It will be called when you set `thirdPartyVerificationChoice` property to `true` and the cardholder makes a card verification choice.

Parameters:
 - a `CardVerificationChoice` case.

 #### enum class CardVerificationChoice _(!Experimental)_

A card verification choice expressed by the cardholder, when a third party verification choice is enabled.

Cases:
- `ON_THE_SPOT`: It means that the cardholder acknowledges that the verification token can be accessed and card verification can be done on the spot.
- `DELEGATED_TO_THIRD_PARTY`: The cardholder acknowledges that the verification token cannot be accessed and card verification cannot be done on the spot. A third party entity must be involved to verify the card.
