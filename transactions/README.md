## Transactions

The transaction object is the central piece of data of your card-linked application. When a consumer makes a purchase with an linked card at a program's location, FIDEL API spots the transaction and sends it to your server using the `transaction.auth` webhook event.

Application logic can be implemented in real-time, when the user pays in-store (only available on MasterCard. Please email [developer@fidel.uk](fidel.uk) for VISA availability) or when the transaction is cleared usually 24-48 hours after the purchase.

Transaction objects are sent to specified webhooks in JSON format. If youâ€™re using MasterCard real-time transaction notifications, you will receive them as the customer pays in-store. All Visa and Mastercard settled transactions are processed and sent daily at 12:00pm UTC to your servers through `transaction.clearing.success` webhook events.

Please see below the properties of the transaction JSON object are self explanatory.

# Create Transaction

For testing purposes, you can use the **API Playground** to create transactions and test your application logic.

To create a transaction you will need a test program, at least one location where the transaction can be originated from and a webhook where the transaction object will be sent to at creation time. Also a test card will need to be created and linked to the test program.

On the dashboard, go to **API Playground** and click on **Create transaction** on the left menu. The method will be set to POST and the endpoint to _/transactions/test_. An editable sample JSON object like the following one will be use to create the transaction.

To create a test transaction you only need to submit three properties, the `cardId`, `locationId` and the `amount` of the transaction you want.

Click **Send** and a test transaction will be created and sent to the webhook URL created for this program with the event property set to `transaction.auth`. An example of the returned transaction object is represented below.
